# Spell Buidling
Spell building will be one of the most important features inside of the game. Spells can be build from nothing to anything. The build of these spells can decide on the effect desired (offensive, defensive) and added special features on top of those effects (e.g. elemental augmentation).

## First Step - Choosing Spell Effect
Choosing the spell effect will decide which main use the spell will be guided towards. The main directions are hereby for now:

- Attack
- Defense
- Heal
- Utility

## Elemntal Augmentation
Every spell can be extended using an elemental augmentation. An augmentation will enhance the spell add extensive features which depending on the main spell effect will improve the spell in different ways. Different spell augmentations work more or less efficiently against each other.
